L. It must concentrate on semantically significant teat

9 it must be more accurate than is strictly necessary

To satisfy the first constraint, we chose to concentrate on straight edges «
ular orientations in the 3-D scene. Typically, there are three prominent 3-D ta §
in indoor scenes and outdoor urban scenes: the vertical, and tw rizontal orier §
perpendicular to each other. Our approach considers only polyhedral objects w such

edges. This assumption holds for most large architectural features such as
ways, floors, and ceilings. The second constraint, accuracy, has mult
