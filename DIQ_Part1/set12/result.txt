1 Abstract

We track, in real-time, the position and postur
human body, using a minimal number of 6 DOF sen
sors to capture full body stancing postures We use
4 sensors to create @ good approximation of a human
operator's position and posture, and map it on
atticulated computer graphics hurnan model. The
unsensed joints are positioned by a fast inverse kine
matics algorithm. Our goal is to realistically recreate
human postures while minimally encumbering the op
erator.

2 Background

Ideally, a virtual environment interface should be able
to measure and recreate a participant's posture exact
ly. Rather than the traditional “disembodied hand”
approach, we would like to generate a complete, real-
jstically postured human image. However, the equip-
ment needed to accurately track every body segment
(or joint ange) of a hurnan is costly and curnbersome
We face several! questions: how closely must the vir-
tual human’s posture match the operator's, and how
much information do we need to achieve this degree
of realism?

As in other areas of VR, the degree of realism nec-
essary depends greatly on the tasks we would like

to perform [11]. We have concentrated on creating

an interface that will allow a human participant to
perform basic tasks, using a minimal number of sen-
sors to derive feasible, reasonably accurate postures.
Three pieces of information are essential for our pos-
ture reconstruction algorithm: the participant's view
yector, center of mass, and the location of the end-

effectors the participant will use to interact with the
