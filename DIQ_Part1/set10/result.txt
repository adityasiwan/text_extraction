Dear Charlic,

Since returning to London, my colleague Jackie Poets and =f have given more
thought to hew best to capitalize upon the studies on high and tow familial risk

lung cancer which are just being set wp with Henry Lyack. Since Dr. Lynch will be
taking the trouble of mounting the field studies in various types of “high” aad “low”

risk cancer pedigrees. 1 feel strongly that we should not miss the opportasity
establishing immortal cel! lines on cach ef the 400 subjects which we w 32
Such is my conviction that I believe these studics should be started immediately and
not constrained by my move to Neweastic. Mere is my propose

 

Omaha will be recruiting 400 subjects, each phenotyped with «
they will fall into four groups of equal size, sporadic lung can
cancer family history (*low” risk), sporadic lung cancers with positive cancer family
history, colon cancer-prone families with high and low family histories. These
latter two types of pedigree are very interesting from the following point of view
that of the 2000 members of the 10 kindreds, there is onty one known case of lung
cancer. Immortalized EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid B-cell lines will prowide a
future resource for studying the molecular genctios of tung cancer risk We are
alrcady looking in cohorts with cONA probes and RPLP analysis for various P450
polymorphisms which we believe may bear upon tung cancer risk. At relatively
small additional cost (suppicmented by CTR?) Dr. Lynch could mail us small batches
of fresh blood for B-cell transformation. I cannot see how this should add more
than about $5 to the cost of cach sample collection, or $2000 in toro, but he needs to
be asked. At our cnd we shall need Ms. Pontin’s salary with on-costs. ($45,000 for
18 months) together with consumable costs for cell transformation, culture and
cryopreservation of $75 per cell line (ef. $500 NIH contracted - out cost!), Le
$30,000. In addition, we would need to purchase a liquid nitrogen Dewar for
storing the cell lines ($1600). The total cost of the project for the first year would
thus be $51,600 (2/3 $45,000 + 2/3 $30,000 + $1,600)
