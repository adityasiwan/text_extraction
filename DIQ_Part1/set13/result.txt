4.1 Revaita and Evaluation

Figure 4 shows one image in a sequence and the corresponding 2-D line segments 2
The barrel distortion visible in the intensity image is corrected before the liane detector
is run.

Results of the reconstruction of vertical edges in this indoor scene are shown in
Figure 5. The vertical edges are represented by srnal! â€œ+" signs. Both top views are
shown over a one meter spacing grid. The left map represents actual measurements in
the scene. The right map is the result of the reconstruction. The robot was moving
up in the map, acquiring an image every meter. The last position of the robot is
represented by a small dot at the bottom of the map

The comparison of the two maps shows that the accuracy of the reconstruction can
approach the precision of an architectural floor plan [3). In fact, in some instances, the
